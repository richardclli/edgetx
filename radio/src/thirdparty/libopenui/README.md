# libopenui
C++ UI Library primarily used in EdgeTX for Colour LCD targets. 

Was forked from [OpenTX/libopenui](https://github.com/opentx/libopenui) and detached so that contributors can easily work on both if they wish to do so. 

To port the library, copy openui_conf_example.h to your project, rename to openui_conf.h and modify to work within your software.
